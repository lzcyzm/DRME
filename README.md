 # DRME

 The purpose of this directory is to provide the R code for the proposed DRME approach for differential RNA methylation analysis 

 The following files are provided: 

 1. all_functions.R: all the R functions, including the DRME code 
 
 2. test_on_real_data.R: an example for applying the DRME approach to real data 

 3. test_on_simulated_data_example.R: an example for applying the DRME approach to simulated data 

 4. simulation_code.R: R code used for generating the simulation result in the manuscript 

 5. might_useful_scripts.R: code used for comparing the DRME approach and Fisher's test on real data 

 Please contact: Jia Meng (jia.meng@hotmail.com) if you have any questons. The project leader Lian Liu on maternity leave, but I will try my best to help with whatever questions you may have.
